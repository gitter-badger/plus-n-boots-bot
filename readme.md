# plus-n-boots

Your friendly issue +1 cleaning bot.

### Background

Plus-n-boots is built to minimise the noise created by people leaving +1 comments on issues on GitHub.

Inspired by [this issue](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/9) the bot will create a comment on each new issue raised as a place to display a list of all +1 commenters. +1 comments are deleted once they're stored.

The bot currently doesn't get around the issue of emails being sent on each new +1.

You can try plus-n-bot out by raising an issue on the [try-me-out repository](https://github.com/plus-n-boots/try-me-out)
